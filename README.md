# PiPMI
Project to use a Raspberry Pi Zero as an aftermarket IPMI (BMC, Drac, iDrac, et. al.)

## Parts
1. Raspberry Pi Zero WH ('H' has the headers. Get the W if you prefer soldered connections)
  1. Power supply (for getting started)
  2. Keyboard + Mouse (for getting started)
  3. Micro SD card (for OS)
2. Auvidea B102 HDMI to CSI-2 Bridge (get the 101 if you're _not_ using a Pi Zero. Do _*NOT*_ combine the Pi Zero, the B101, and the official Pi camera adaptor ribbon cable)
3. Breadboard jumper cables (other wiring could work, but the tips will come in helpful here.
4. HDMI cables
